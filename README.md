# Asynchronous Chat Application
This is an example of chat application which includes most of requirements that needed for server and clients. Created with UDP sockets for broadcasting. 
 With this app you are able to broadcast 64kb data. You can change it easily on source code on Client and Server class. Also does not have any database access
so does not contains any data permamently. I hope it can help you and can fulfill your purpose.
